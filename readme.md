### Discrete Class-D Amplifier ###

Let's design a discrete Class-D amplifier consisting only out of opamps, comparators, gate-drivers , power-mosfets and some passives.
I will show you how to simulate everything in LTSpice (transient, but also in AC domain to obtain correct feedback-loop stability).
